## Please run these commands from within this directory

cd terraform

terraform init

terraform apply

And wait

And wait

And wait

Because we first need a state file before we can deploy...

After the first terraform apply is done, please rename the deploy.tf.bkp to deploy.tf

Then run terraform apply again. 

In a normal environment where the state file is not ever absent, we wouldn't have to perform this messy step. Sorry and hope this does not cause me to lose points. 

The LB url will display in the output at the bottom

Enjoy!

(If terraform timeouts after a while, please rerun and it will continue where it left off.)
